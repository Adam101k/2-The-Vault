# About
To The Vault was Solo developed in 15 days as a personal challenge to improve my 2D game skills. This prototype outlines a simple roguelike where you progress through rooms of enemies with a final boss you must beat to win the game. This project was done during the Winter of 2023.

# GDD
When developing this game, I created a Game Design Document to ensure that I remained consistent while maintaining scope. If you want to check out the GDD, I've provided a link below for the original Google Document. </br>
